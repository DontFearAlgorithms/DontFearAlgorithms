# Don't Fear Algos


Honestly speaking, the title is a re-assurance to myself.

All this time, I've been involved with algorithms day-in-and-day-out, but I've never really felt competent in Algorithms, sub-consciously equating them with the knowledge of, monsters which are, `C++` and `Java`.

I've reached the point where the validation about Algorithmic knowledge has become **intrinsic** and I wish to be satisfied with my honest effort.

The goal of the entire effort is to be proficient in Algorithms, be confident in my bones about my grasp of these ideas. 

## Programming Languages
- Scala
- Julia
- Racket ( Typed )


** I'll rely on SageMath for various understanding and exploring various mathematical ideas and concepts.

 I, of course, shall peek solutions to various ways of doing things after an honest attempts. I realize that this project will take a lot of time so I'm in for the long run ;P
